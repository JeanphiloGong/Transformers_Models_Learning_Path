\subsection*{Mathematical induction}

Mathematical induction is a way to prove some statement about the integer \( n \) is true for all \( n \geq n_0 \). First we prove the statement when \( n \) has its smallest value, \( n_0 \); this is called the basis. Then we prove the statement for \( n > n_0 \), assuming that it has already been proved for all values between \( n_0 \) and \( n - 1 \), inclusive; this is called the induction. Such a proof gives infinitely many results with only a finite amount of work.
